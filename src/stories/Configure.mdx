# Decentralized Credit UI Library

A React-based UI library. Built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components.

Install with `pnpm i @decentralized-credit/ui-library`

## Using the UI Library

Refer to the docs page on each story for details on how to use the components.
There is a control panel on the story page for each component that has props you can change.

## Notes

Some components need to be remounted to see the changes.
This is the remount button in the toolbar at the top of the screen:

<img src={RemountBtn} alt="Remount Button" width={400} />
