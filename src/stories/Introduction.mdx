## Contributing

### Development Workflow

When adding a new component:

- Open an issue in the repository with the name of the component
- Include component purpose, behaviors, variants, and props API design
- Add documentation in Storybook following our standards

### Component Implementation Guidelines

1. **TypeScript and Typing**:

   - Use TypeScript interfaces for props
   - Export types for consumers
   - Avoid using `any` and use proper type constraints

2. **Accessibility**:

   - Follow WAI-ARIA practices
   - Include proper ARIA attributes
   - Ensure keyboard navigation support

3. **Styling**:

   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Ensure responsiveness across breakpoints

4. **Best Practices**:
   - Keep components focused on a single responsibility
   - Implement proper prop validation
   - Prefer functional components with hooks

### Storybook Documentation Standards

Each component should have stories that include:

- Basic usage example
- Variants showcase
- Interactive controls for all props
- Dark mode example when applicable
- Responsive behavior demonstrations
- Accessibility status and notes

## Notes

Some components need to be remounted to see the changes.
This is the remount button in the toolbar at the top of the screen:

<img src={RemountBtn} alt="Remount Button" width={400} />
